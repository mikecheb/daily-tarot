  upright: "The major arcana tell the story of an individual's path towards completion. Being the first card, The Fool therefore is a blank slate, a representation of purity and innocence of a child that knows nothing of the world. New journeys are signaled here, and The Fool is full of exuberance and energy. He does not know the dangers that can beset him during his travels, and thus he stumbles forward with complete optimism, never suspecting that he may be walking on a thin tightrope.",
  reversed: 'In your excitement to start a new journey, you have not heeded the dangers that surround you. This card suggests excessive eagerness and no awareness of consequences. You must plan more carefully your journey ahead. Who else do your actions affect?',
